# Joseph Gordon Love-it or Leave-it

## Introduction

There are many websites out there for reviewing movies, but none of them are specifically for the films of Americaâ€™s heart-throb, Joseph Gordon Levitt without having to look through the films of lesser heart-throbs such as Ryan Gosling, Joe Jonas, or any given Hemsworth brother.

The homepage displays the average rating for each movie across all sources and users.

The Movie posters are dynamically populated from an external API

## Goals

For this project i wanted to go through a series of
technologies and concepts that I felt would be incredibly
beneficial to add to my proffessional tool set.
This included the use of small algorithms, Npm packages,
modals, intense modularization, and becoming familiar with ReactStrap.

## What I Learned

I became MUCH more familiar with modularization, reusability and how beneficial both of these practices are when building web apps.

Also,
I learned that if you're going to make a silly app about a celebrity,
you should probably choose a celebrity that you actually like.
I'm not a huge fan of JGL _(I only made this because the pun was too good to throw away)_, and not being a huge fan, I quickly grew tired of looking at his face for hours at a time. Next time I'll create **Paul Rudd-or-Dudd**
