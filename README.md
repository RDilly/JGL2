# Joseph Gordon Love-it or Leave-it

## Introduction

There are many websites out there for reviewing movies, but none of them are specifically for the films of Americaâ€™s heart-throb, Joseph Gordon Levitt without having to look through the films of lesser heart-throbs such as Ryan Gosling, Joe Jonas, or any given Hemsworth brother.

## Goals

For this project i wanted to go through a series of technologies and concepts that I felt would be incredibly beneficial to add to my proffessional tool set. This included the use of small algorithms, Npm packages, modals, intense modularization, and becoming familiar with ReactStrap.
